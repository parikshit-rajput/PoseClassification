# Human Pose Estimation and Pose Classification
## Hey there! Welcome

This project is inspired by various Machine Learning models for Pose Estimation or visual recognition and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Pose Classification. The models or datasets used were made by collecting & training the data during development and are not taken from anywhere.  
This project uses Pose.Net, developed by Googleâ€™s TensorFlow and p5.js & ml5.js, JavaScript library for Machine Learning on the browser.
